# django_clean_template
A clean template for developing small projects (one-page).

The easiest way to develop a one page with Django.

1) Just customize your folders the way you want (you probably want to add a static dir with css, imgs, js...)
2) Place your .html file in the templates folder (/core/templates) ! I strongly suggests that the name of your .html file is index.html
3) You can start your webapp running $python manage.py runserver

This template supports sending e-mails by using Django-templated-email. 
An amazing module for sending e-mails. For more info: https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-templated-email
